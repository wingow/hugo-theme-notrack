Hello, I'm Wingo and this is my personal page. I am a full-stack engineer and 
artist with experience as a Web3 product manager, I have a keen interest in 
cutting-edge technologies such as AI, Web3, robotics, and Mars exploration.
I have written articles on art history and entrepreneurial insights, 
and occasionally create poetry and scripts. 
I have served as a Web3 product manager, gaining valuable work experience. 
Although my first attempt at entrepreneurship ended in failure, 
I learned many skills and plan to continue venturing into business and 
creation in the future.
 For a more comprehensive list of my experience,
see the [Resume]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}) tab.

I enjoy creating not only products but also articles and short films. 
I am still on the path of creation and constantly learning a wealth of knowledge. 

I have a small gallery of works of art depicting me under the [Gallery]({{< ref "hugo-gallery.md" >}}) tab.
I regularly post lorem ipsum om my [Blog]({{< ref "blog/_index.md" >}}), and
there are also examples of how to include images in the theme of the site.
If you want to get in touch, you can find my social media links and email
address under the [Contact]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) tab.
